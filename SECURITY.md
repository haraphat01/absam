# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Absad MultiSynergy website.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Form Validation
- **Zod Schema Validation**: All forms use Zod schemas with enhanced security rules
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized using DOMPurify and custom sanitization functions
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML content is sanitized to prevent script injection
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use parameterized queries through Supabase

#### Validation Schemas
- Contact form: Name, email, and message validation with XSS protection
- Invoice form: Client details and items with size limits and content validation
- User creation: Email validation and strong password requirements
- Company settings: Banking details with format validation
- File uploads: Type, size, and content validation

### 2. Rate Limiting

#### API Endpoint Protection
- **General API Routes**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Sensitive Endpoints** (contact, auth, users): 20 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **File Upload Endpoints**: 10 requests per hour per IP
- **Contact Form**: 5 submissions per 15 minutes per IP
- **User Creation**: 10 user creations per hour per admin

#### Implementation
- In-memory rate limiting store (production should use Redis)
- IP-based identification with support for proxy headers
- Configurable limits per endpoint type
- Proper HTTP 429 responses with Retry-After headers

### 3. Secure Headers Configuration

#### Next.js Security Headers
```javascript
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: [Comprehensive CSP policy]
```

#### API Response Headers
- Cache-Control: no-store for API responses
- Pragma: no-cache
- Expires: 0

### 4. File Upload Security

#### Video Testimonial Uploads
- **File Type Validation**: Only MP4, WebM, OGG formats allowed
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 50MB per file
- **File Name Sanitization**: Dangerous extensions blocked (.exe, .bat, .js, etc.)
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Null bytes and ".." sequences blocked
- **Secure File Storage**: Files stored in Supabase Storage with secure naming

#### Security Measures
- File content type verification
- Extension whitelist validation
- Virus scanning ready (can be integrated)
- Secure filename generation with timestamps and random strings

### 5. Authentication and Authorization

#### Enhanced Security
- **Role-Based Access Control**: ADMIN and STAFF roles with different permissions
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling through Supabase Auth
- **Password Requirements**: Strong password policy enforced
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

#### Route Protection
- Middleware-based route protection
- Admin route authentication
- API endpoint authorization
- User profile validation

### 6. HTTPS Enforcement

#### Production Security
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects in production
- HSTS headers for browser security
- Secure cookie settings
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Utilities

### Sanitization Functions
```javascript
import { sanitize } from '@/lib/security'

// HTML sanitization
const cleanHtml = sanitize.html(userInput)

// Text sanitization
const cleanText = sanitize.text(userInput)

// Email sanitization
const cleanEmail = sanitize.email(userInput)

// Object sanitization (recursive)
const cleanObject = sanitize.object(userObject)
```

### Rate Limiting
```javascript
import { withRateLimit } from '@/lib/security'

// Apply rate limiting to API route
export const POST = withRateLimit(handler, {
  maxRequests: 10,
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  message: 'Too many requests'
})
```

### File Upload Validation
```javascript
import { fileUpload } from '@/lib/security'

const validation = fileUpload.validate(file, {
  allowedTypes: ['video/mp4', 'video/webm'],
  maxSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB
  allowedExtensions: ['mp4', 'webm']
})
```

### Password Validation
```javascript
import { password } from '@/lib/security'

const validation = password.validate(userPassword)
// Returns: { valid, errors, strength, strengthLabel }
```

## üîç Security Testing
